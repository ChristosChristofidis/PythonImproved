Python Improved v2.1.0
======================



To take full advantage of the extra scopes included in Python Improved, check out
the Neon Color Scheme at https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Neon%20Color%20Scheme
If you'd rather modify your own color scheme, a list of scopes is included in
the README.md on GitHub at https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved#readme

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, bugs, or patches, please open an
issue or pull request on GitHub and I'll do what I can to help out. You can also
email me directly at <mattdmo@pigimal.com> or find me on Twitter at @MattDMo.
This is definitely a work in progress, so if you'd like to contribute I'd love
to hear from you!
